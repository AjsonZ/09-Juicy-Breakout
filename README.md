This project is to make this game jucier.
I added camera, time, tweening and some music to it, but only tweening and music work.
I added exactly the same codes of time and camera as professor did, but for some reasons they don't work. I tried hard and still can't find bugs. 
The process was interesting. Typing a bunch of codes can make you to understand more about some small details you didn't mention before.
